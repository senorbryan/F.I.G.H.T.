# F.I.G.H.T.
F.I.G.H.T. is a Python RPG program. In the program, the player wins by successfully defeating a set number of enemies. Should the player's HP fall below 0, they lose the game and must start over. Further patches to the RPG will implement more combat options, stats, and quality of life improvements.
